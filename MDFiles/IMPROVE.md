# Here are guidelines to make improvements to the program

## Yolo version

In case a new more performing YOLO version is released, download the weights and put them in the `weights` folder. Then in `GUI.py`, modify this line :
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/YOLO_version.png?raw=true" alt="Yolo version" title="Yolo version" width="45%"/><br>
  <em>YOLO version</em>
</p>
You need to change the generic version on the yolo models (e.g. `yolov8{m}.pt` or `yolo11{m}.pt`). The `{m}` placeholder will change automatically depending on the model size chosen when running. *Check the name of the new version's models to ensure writing in the right generic version.

## Tracking parameters

### Lines for modification

The vehicle tracking is done using BoT-SORT. The parameters are available in `TransmobYTC/Analyze.py` (for GPU version, otherwise `TransmobYT/Analyze.py`) at the lines :
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="45%">
      <img src="images/Tracker_YTC.png?raw=true" alt="YTC tracker" title="YTC tracker"/>
      <br/><sub>YTC Tracker</sub>
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="45%">
      <img src="images/Tracker_YT.png?raw=true" alt="YT tracker" title="YT tracker"/>
      <br/><sub>YT Tracker</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Tracker Parameters

| General Settings      | Detection & Tracking        | Matching Criteria        |
|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **`cmc_method`**: Camera motion correction method. | **`track_high_thresh`**: Min confidence for detection association. | **`match_thresh`**: IoU threshold for detection-track matching. |
| **`device`**: `cuda:0` (GPU) or `cpu`. | **`track_low_thresh`**: Min confidence for tracking. | **`proximity_thresh`**: Max allowed bounding box distance. |
| **`half`**: Use FP16 for speed if supported. | **`new_track_thresh`**: Min confidence to start a new track. | **`appearance_thresh`**: Min similarity score for ReID matches. |
| **`frame_rate`**: Affects track buffer length. | **`track_buffer`**: Frames to keep a lost track alive. | **`fuse_first_associate`**: Use both appearance & motion cues initially. |
| **`with_reid`**: Enable ReID-based tracking. | | **`reid_weights`**: Path to ReID model weights. |
| **`per_class`**: Track objects separately per class. |   |   |


*\* IoU : Area of Intersection / Area of Union*

### Tuning Tips
- **Too many ID switches?** Increase `track_buffer`, lower `match_thresh`, `proximity_thresh`, `appearance_thresh`.
- **False associations?** Increase `match_thresh`, `proximity_thresh`, `appearance_thresh`.
- **Missed objects?** Lower `new_track_thresh`, `track_high_thresh`.
- **Track loss after occlusion?** Increase `track_buffer`, adjust `appearance_thresh`.

## Train a new model

Numerous tutorial are available online to train a custom model of YOLO. They may require different actions depending od the current YOLO version in use. Here is the official [Ultralytics training page](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) valid as of YOLOv12. The page contains all the available parameters, as well as a video tutorial for a step by step showing of the process.

Training a new model may require a new dataset, some can be found on websites such as [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

## OnlyVans

OnlyVans is the model created specifically to identify vans, in order to prevent cars to be mistakenly categorized as trucks. The original version was based on YOLO11, and trained on [this dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/maryam-mahmood-6hoeq/vans/dataset/3). If you trained a model, here is how to use it : in `TransmobYTC/Vehicle.py`
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/OnlyVans_import.png?raw=true" alt="OnlyVans import" title="OnlyVans import" width="45%"/>
  <br>
  <em>OnlyVans import</em>
</p>
Change the path to the model's weights.
